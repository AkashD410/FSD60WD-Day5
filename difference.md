Understanding the difference between `window`, `screen`, and `document` objects in JavaScript is fundamental for web development. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. Window Object:
   The `window` object represents the browser window that contains the DOM document.
   It is the global object in client-side JavaScript, and its properties and methods are available globally.
   It provides access to various browser-related functionalities such as navigation, manipulation of browser history, opening and closing windows, setting timeouts, etc.
   The `window` object acts as a container for other objects, including the `document` and `screen` objects.

2. Document Object:
   The `document` object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
   It provides methods and properties to access and manipulate the content of the HTML document, such as accessing elements by their IDs or class names, modifying element styles and content, handling events, etc.
   The `document` object is a child of the `window` object and is accessible via `window.document` or simply `document`.
   It is the primary interface for interacting with the structure and content of the web page.

3.Screen Object:
   The `screen` object represents the user's screen or monitor.
   It provides information about the user's screen, such as the width and height of the screen, color depth, pixel depth, etc.
   The properties of the `screen` object are read-only and give information about the capabilities and dimensions of the display.
   The `screen` object is also a child of the `window` object and is accessible via `window.screen` or simply `screen`.

In summary:
`window` represents the browser window and provides access to various browser-related functionalities.
`document` represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window and provides methods to manipulate its content.
`screen` represents the user's screen or monitor and provides information about its dimensions and capabilities.

Understanding these objects and their respective roles is crucial for effective web development and JavaScript programming.
